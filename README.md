# Data-driven clustering of secretory bone and inflammatory markers to sub-phenotype hemodialysis patients: A multicentric, observational study
This is the repository containing the core analysis code in the paper: Data-driven clustering of secretory bone and inflammatory markers to sub-phenotype hemodialysis patients: A multicentric, observational study

The HEMOcalc study is a multicentric, observational cohort study including hemodialysis patients from 4 different centers accross Austria. Observational data and blood samples were collected from 4 centers for quality control and harmonized measurements by Immundiagnostik AG Bensheim, Germany.

To further explore the phenotypic spectrum of CKD-MBD, we here perform an unbiased data-driven subclassification of hemodialysis patients using distance-based clustering on a biomarkers panel reflecting core pathophysiological traits in a real-world patient cohort. This is the code for this analysis.
